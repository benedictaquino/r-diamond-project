Diamond pricing model created using multivariate linear regression techniques on a data set containing information on ***n*** = **308** round diamonds, including their **price**, **carat**, **clarity**, **color**, and **cut**.

  - **Carat**: The weight of a diamond stone is indicated in terms of carat units. One carat is equivalent to 0.2 grams. All other things being equal, larger diamond stones command higher prices in view of their rarity.
  
  - **Clarity**: Diamonds with no inclusion under a loupe with a 10 power magnification are labelled IF (“internally flawless”). Lesser diamonds are categorizedin descending order as “very very slightly imperfect” (VVS1 or VVS2)and “very slightly imperfect” (VS1 or VS2).
  
  - **Color**: The most prized diamonds display color purity. They are not contaminated with yellow or brown tones. Top color purity attracts a grade of D. Subsequent degrees of color purity are rated E, F, G, etc.
  
  - **Cut**: The cut (or faceting) of a raw diamond stone relies on the experience and the craftsmanship of the diamond cutter. The optimal cut should neither be too deep nor too shallow for it will impede the trajectory of light and thereby the brilliance or “fire” of a diamond stone. To assist shoppers, independent certification bodies assay diamond stones and provide each of them with a certificate listing their caratage and their grades of clarity, color and cut. Three of the most common certification bodies include the New York based Gemmological Institute of America (GIA), the Antwerp based International Gemmological Institute (IGI),and HogeRaad Voor Diamant (HRD). Their reputations could be a factor in the pricing of the diamond stones.
